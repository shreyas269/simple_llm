The Last Train Home
The station was nearly empty, except for a few scattered passengers waiting for the last train. The old clock above the platform read 11:57 PM—three minutes before departure.

Ethan clutched his ticket, shifting nervously. This train was his last chance to leave the city before morning, before they found him. He glanced around, his heart pounding. No signs of trouble. Yet.

The whistle blew, and the doors slid open with a hiss. Ethan stepped inside, choosing a seat near the back. The train was dimly lit, eerily silent. Only a handful of passengers sat, their faces hidden behind newspapers or dim phone screens.

As the train rumbled forward, he exhaled in relief. Maybe he had escaped.

Then, he saw her.

A woman in a dark coat, sitting two rows ahead. He couldn't see her face, but something about her felt… off. The way she sat too still. The way she never checked her phone or glanced at the window.

Then she moved. Slowly, deliberately. She turned her head just enough for Ethan to see her eyes—cold, knowing.

She smiled.

Ethan’s blood ran cold.

This train wasn’t taking him home.

It was taking him somewhere else.
